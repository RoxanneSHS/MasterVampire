@1   = ~Vernon's got us working like the dogs he and his kin leave bleedin' all over the ranch.~
@2   = ~Sorry, friend, but I can't stand here gabbing all day with you.  The family wouldn't be pleased if my work doesn't get done, and I ain't gonna risk my neck for you, if you catch my meaning.~
@3   = ~Vernon might not be able to come out here during the day, but sure as his heart's cold he'll see me if I ain't working.~
@4   = ~The north fence needs to be mended.  Some horses bolted during the night- think they were spooked when the family was out of the big house- and Vernon's in another one of his moods.  I sure don't want to be on his bad side.~
@5   = ~If you see any of the barnyard animals- not the drained ones though- roaming in the valley, we're looking for some that ran off.  I'll have to get them back, else Vernon will have my neck.~
@6   = ~You ain't right in the head showin' up here.  Vernon's in a mood now.  If I were you, I'd climb back up on the horse I rode in on.~
@7   = ~Actually, that's what I'm going to do before the manure hits the windmill.  See you around, partner.~
@8   = ~Vernon ain't gonna be pleased to see you back on his farm.  Be your best bet to climb back up on the horse you rode in on.~
